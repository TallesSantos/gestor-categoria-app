- No user behavior is tracked.
- No analytics or monitoring tools are used.
- No cookies or external storage mechanisms are used.

## 2. Local Storage Only

All content created by the user (categories, fields, records, etc.) is **stored exclusively on the user’s device** using a local SQLite database.

No information is transmitted to any external server.

The app **does not share data** with any third parties, including:

- Companies
- Advertisers

## 6. Security

Because data is stored locally, its security depends on the user’s device.

Since users have full control over their data, they may:

- Delete the app to remove all stored data.
